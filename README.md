I added what I learned in week four:

- I create the three media queries dimensions (Mobile, tablet and desktop)
- I work with the concept mobile first.
- I redistributed the ticket order logic within the media queries (going from large to small tag order to tag order by sections), making it easier to search for tags and work by sections.
